Welcome to PARTICLE SIMULATOR
============================================
Thankyou for choosing to try our simulator! 
We hope you will learn something and most importantly have fun!

EXPLANATION
--------------------------------------------
This is a particle simulator... But what does that mean?
Our universe is made up of planets, stars, asteroids, moons, black holes...
The list goes on and on!

Each of these comsmic bodies follows "The Law of Universal Gravitation"!!
This law basically states that every body of mass in the universe is attracted
to every other body of mass. This is why the moon orbits the earth and doesn't 
just fly away!

This program simulates some simple particles, with their own properties such as mass, 
and dispays the outcome of an interaction between these particles. 

For example, your particle might have just the right mass and velocity, and start in just the right
spot to follow a stable orbit of the gravity source! Or it might fly straight past or even crash!

Its up to you to choose the initial conditions of the particle, and observe the outcome!


GETTING STARTED
--------------------------------------------
You will be prompted to enter a whole bunch of numbers, 
but dont let this scare you! Here is a simple explanation on each 
to make your experience as smooth as possible!

Initial position:
This is where the particle will start on the screen! The axis starts from the top left corner, and is positive down, and right!
As shown below:

Initial velocity:
This is how fast the particle will be traveling at the beginning of the simulation! This will greatly impact the final outcome. 
Velocity follows the same coordinate system as position!

Mass:
This will decide how heavy the particle is! The gravity source has a mass of 10000 so make sure to try values far smaller than
this for realistic orbits. Experiment! see what works and what doesnt!
